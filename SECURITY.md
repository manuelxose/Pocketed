# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Report them privately via one of:

- GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)
  ("Security" tab → "Report a vulnerability"), or
- email **hi@krypt.cc**.

Please include reproduction steps and the affected version. We'll acknowledge as soon as we can.

## Handling of credentials

Krypt PolyBot stores your **Polygon wallet private key** (and the Polymarket CLOB API credentials
derived from it) **locally** in the app's user-data directory
(`%APPDATA%/Krypt PolyBot/credentials/` on Windows). They are used only to sign orders/requests to
Polymarket and are **never transmitted to any server operated by this project**. Anyone with the
private key controls that wallet's funds, so use a dedicated trading wallet.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On **Windows**, credentials are encrypted at rest with the OS keystore (**DPAPI**,
> `CryptProtectData`) — tied to your user account, with no key stored on disk; existing plaintext
> files are upgraded automatically on first read. On non-Windows dev builds they fall back to
> plaintext (the app ships on Windows). Either way, protect the machine you run this on.

If you believe your keys may have been exposed, revoke them in your Polymarket account settings and
generate a new pair.

## User strategy scripts (the Scripts tab)

Krypt PolyBot runs **user-authored Python** in the same process that holds the decrypted wallet key,
with the same privileges as the trading engine. There is **no language sandbox**.

> [!WARNING]
> **A strategy script is a program you are running on your machine.** It can do anything your user
> account can do: read and write your files, open network connections, and reach the wallet key held
> in this process. Treat a script from someone else — or from an AI — exactly as you would treat any
> executable you downloaded from them, because that is what it is. Read it first.

This is a deliberate change from earlier versions, which validated scripts against an AST whitelist
(no imports, no classes, curated builtins only). That whitelist blocked most useful Python while
never being a real security boundary — CPython sandboxes are escapable in principle, and the docs
said so. Rather than offer a guarantee it could not keep, the app now **reviews instead of
restricting**.

**The risk audit.** Every script is statically scanned (`python/script_audit.py`) on save, on
validate, and before it can be armed. It reports, with line numbers:

- **network** — sockets, HTTP clients, websockets, mail, DNS, `webbrowser`
- **wallet** — the app's own credential modules (`polymarket_auth`, `polymarket_api`, `trader`, …),
  the OS keyring, and credential-shaped identifiers/strings (`private_key`, `mnemonic`, `.env`, …)
- **exfiltration** — a synthesized critical finding when a script does *both* of the above, which is
  the shape of a key-stealing script
- **dynamic** — `eval`/`exec`/`compile`, `__import__`, `importlib`, `pickle`/`marshal`, base64 and
  hex decoding, `getattr` with a computed name, and long encoded literals
- **process / filesystem** — `subprocess`, `os.system`, `ctypes`, file writes and deletions
- **env / introspection** — `os.environ`, `sys.modules`, frame walking

Obfuscation is reported as **critical in its own right**. A static scan cannot see through it, so
"this script is hiding what it does" is the only honest thing the tool can say about such code.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The audit is a smoke detector, not a lock. Clean findings mean *nothing known-dangerous was
> recognized* — never *safe*. Nothing in the app blocks a script from running; the audit informs the
> user, and arming a flagged script requires passing a confirmation that names the findings.

**What is still enforced.** The **money rails** are not advisory and are unchanged: max entry price,
max contracts per order, max open positions per script, a per-script daily-loss breaker, and one
entry attempt per market window. A script cannot place an order the rails would refuse, and where a
cap and the exchange's own minimum contradict each other the entry is refused rather than rounded up
past the cap. Liveness is enforced too: every hook runs in a joined worker thread with a hard
wall-clock timeout, and a hook that overruns is abandoned and its script auto-disabled.

**What we consider a reportable vulnerability here:**

- A way to bypass the **money rails**, or to place an order from a script the rails should have
  refused.
- A path that enables a script or arms it for real orders without the user's explicit in-app
  confirmation.
- A script that hangs or crashes the engine loop rather than being auto-disabled.
- A **false-clean audit**: source that performs network, credential or dynamic-execution access via
  a route `script_audit.py` reports as clean. (Obfuscated code that the audit correctly flags as
  obfuscated is working as designed, not a bug.)

**What is not:** anything a script does once the user has run it — scripts are unsandboxed by
design, and that is stated in the app before a script can be enabled or armed. Nor is strategy
performance or losses.

## Scope

This project ships a desktop app (Electron) plus a local Python backend. Reports of concern include:
credential handling, the IPC boundary, request signing, the user-script money rails and risk audit
(see above), and any path that could place unintended orders. The bundled trading strategies are out
of scope — strategy performance is not a security issue (see the [Disclaimer](./DISCLAIMER.md)).
